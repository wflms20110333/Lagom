# Lagom

"Lagom" (pronounced law-gum) is the Swedish word for "just the right amount". We hope this application provides you with a way to implement this "not too little, not too much" philosophy into your daily life by helping you find a balance between work, play, and relaxation.

This Chrome extension has three primary modes:

-*Focus*: This feature allows the User to (blacklist) block certain websites on the Chrome browser for a User-chosen period of time.

-*Break*: After each Focus period, the User will enter a Break period where any websites can be accessed for a User-chosen period.

-*Unplug*: This feature will prohibit the User from accessing any websites on Chrome for a certain period of time. All current tabs and new tabs will be redirected to our website, and after the Unplug period is over, the tabs will return to the pages open before the Unplug period began.
